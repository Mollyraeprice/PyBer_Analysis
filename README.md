# PyBer_Analysis
### Module 5

## Overview
### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was in response to the CEO asking for a more in depth analysis with the ridesharing data at PyBer. We created a visual to display the summary of ridesharing by city type.

## Results
### City Type

The three city types we have data analytics for is urban, suburban, and rural. We can look at the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare type to catagorize each city type.

Looking at the  visualization above, we can see that urban cities have the most amount of drivers and riders, while rural has the least. In congruence with this, urban brings in the largest revenue and rural brings in the least. Although, when looking at the average fare per ride and driver, rural comes in first for the highest average per ride and this time, urban is last. This means that while rural drivers may have less rides, they could possibly make more bang for their buck with their rural rides. Lastly, lets look at the total fare numbers in the third column. Urban is almost 10x more lucradive than the total fare amount in rural areas, while suburban has been consistently in the middle of this analysis. 

## Summary
### Final Visualization

Above, we can see a line chart that analyzes the total fare by city type. This graph is exactly what the CEO was asking for. We can draw a few ideas from this graph with the information we learned from the earlier chart. 
Urban cities are where the majority of ridesharing is happening. This is where we could focus our attention and future investments. We want to maintin this city type without overwhelming our drivers. How can we help them continue to do what they are already doing? Another idea is to grow our suburban city type. There seems to be oppourtunity for growth in such a high popluated area. How can we do this? I would lastly recommend building a small team for the rural drivers. This could help build a platform for this city type that is much more different than its counterparts. The team can have a close knit relationship with our rural drivers, figuring out how to best help them.
